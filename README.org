* Overview

This mode profiles on every save the current haskell buffer.

Results will be displayed directly as overlays in the buffer.

* Usage

Put this file into your load path and put in your .emacs (require
'hs-profile).  Run hs-profile-run to make a one time profile or run
hs-profile-mode to automatically reprofile on every save.

Profiling is done asynchronously, so don't worry about blocking emacs.

* Dependencies

It requires
- visual-prof from hackage
- GNU R (for plots)

Furthermore, used modules must be installed with profiling enabled.

* Shortcomings

At least for now, only executable work which don't need any command
line argument.  Processes won't get killed, so if you write something
which takes a lot time to run, it will run until it terminates or you
kill it.  For retrieving profiling data, your code must be executed,
so be aware when you use this with code which operates a lot with IO.
